## 🛡️ Secure Image Steganography GUI App

Hide and extract **AES-encrypted messages** inside images using **LSB steganography**, with a user-friendly Python GUI.

---

### ✨ Features

* 🔐 AES-256 Encryption (password protected)
* 🖼️ Hide encrypted messages in `.png` or `.jpg` images
* 🔍 Extract and decrypt hidden messages
* 🧑‍💻 Easy-to-use GUI with:

  * Image preview
  * Progress bar
  * Drag and drop support

### 📁 Project Structure

```
SecureStegoGUI/
├── aes_encryption.py       # AES encryption with password-based key
├── steganography.py        # LSB image steganography logic
├── main_gui.py             # GUI application using Tkinter
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

### 🔧 Requirements

Install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies:**

* `pillow` – for image processing
* `pycryptodome` – for AES encryption

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.

2. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the GUI:

   ```bash
   python main_gui.py
   ```

### 🖥️ GUI Walkthrough

* ✅ **Encrypt & Hide**

  * Type your **secret message**
  * Enter a **password**
  * Select a **cover image**
  * The output is saved as `yourimage_output.png`

* ✅ **Extract & Decrypt**

  * Select the **output image**
  * Enter the **correct password**
  * Get back the original **decrypted message**

---

### 🔐 Security

* Uses **AES-256 CBC mode**
* Key is derived using **SHA-256** from user-entered password
* Without the correct password, the message **cannot be decrypted**

---

### 📦 Convert to .EXE (Optional)

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main_gui.py
```

Output: `dist/main_gui.exe`

---

### 🧠 Future Improvements

* Custom encryption keys
* Multi-language support
* Embed file steganography
* Stealth mode or auto-delete after decoding
